Task 1: Javascript
==============

Description
--------------
Build a simple HTML/JS app which, when you open the site, asks for a permission to read your current location, and then uses the http://openweathermap.org/current public API to fetch the weather for that location and displays it.
If the user denies to share the location, show a little input form for entering postcode or country, and display the weather based on that location.

Instructions
--------------

The main focus of this activity is to access your JavaScript skills. Therefore, style the app appropriately using your own judgement.
Upload the completed project to your Github account, and send us a link.
You can use any JavaScript library and/or framework, such as jQuery, AngularJS, etc.

Extra brownie points!
--------------
Use object-oriented JavaScript to organise your code (hint: use classes, inheritance, etc.).
Structure your code to be clean, efficient and maintainable.
Write a front-end test, which would take a postcode and display the weather for that postcode.
Use of design patterns would be a plus.
Anything else that could make us say wow!
